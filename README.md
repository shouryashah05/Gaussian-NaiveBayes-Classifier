# Gaussian-NaiveBayes-Classifier
This project implements a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier to predict passenger survival on the Titanic disaster using the famous Kaggle Titanic dataset. Naive Bayes is a probabilistic ML algorithm based on Bayes' Theorem, which assumes independence between features. Despite this simplification, it performs remarkably well for classification tasks.
